## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/AlyraButerin/Allfeat-EVM-bridge-POC.git
   cd Allfeat-EVM-bridge-POC/hardhat
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   _Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run:_

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Hardhat:
   If Hardhat is not installed globally, you can install it using:

   ```shell
   npx hardhat
   ```

4. Install jq (if not already installed):

   - On MacOS: `brew install jq`
   - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install jq`
   - On Fedora: `sudo dnf install jq`
   - On CentOS: `sudo yum install jq`

   Check the installation by running `jq --version`.

## Usage

### User perspective

From a user's standpoint, interacting with the deployed bridge requires a few steps. The user needs to initiate an operation on the source chain and then deposit the necessary fees on the destination chain.

To complete this process, the user must call two specific functions on the BridgeBase contract:

- On the origin chain:

```solidity
createBridgeOperation(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 chainIdFrom,
        uint256 chainIdTo,
        string memory tokenName,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 nonce,
        bytes calldata signature
    )
```

The value sent with the tx if it's a native transfer should be equal to amount, or 0 in case of ERC20.

- On the destination chain:

```solidity
depositFees(bytes32 operationHash, uint256 chainIdFrom, uint256 chainIdTo)
```

Where `operationHash` is the hash of the params given to `createBridgeOperation` (without the signature).

The value sent with the tx should be equal to the needed fees.

- Scripts are available within the project to facilitate these operations and make the user experience smoother:

  - `scripts/11_userAction_deposit.js`
  - `scripts/12_userAction_depositFees.js`

### Dev perspective

For developers working on this project, several standard Hardhat commands are available to assist in development and testing.

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```

For a comprehensive guide to all available commands, please refer to the [COMMAND.md file](COMMANDS.md):
